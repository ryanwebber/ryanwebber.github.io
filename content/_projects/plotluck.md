## About

I have a few friends who read quite a lot, and when they get together they
really nerd out over this shared interest. This level of nerdiness out over
anything is awesome, and I wanted to come up with a way to enhance that
experience.

With some inspiration from the daily nature of Wordle, I had an idea for a
monthly Bingo-style game. Essentially, every month you'd get a bunch of
randomly generated bingo cards where the cells represent achievements,
tropes, themes, and other common elements of books, such as:
 * Read a book in a day
 * "Enemies to lovers" trope
 * "Main character dies" twist
 * etc...

As the month goes on, you would read books and cross off cells on your Cards.
The more you read, the more cells you hope to cross off, the more Bingos you hope
to get, and the higher your Bingo streak gets! 

I whipped up a quick prototype, and despite not being a designer or having much
experience building UIs in my career, I think it looks _really good_.

## The Missing Piece

I have no content for the game. I had some LLMs generate enough content to show
this off (as you might be able to tell from the screenshots), but I'll need thousands
of cell entries to make this feel good enough to play every month, and across enough
genres to appeal to a wide audience. I'm still thinking of ways to source this content,
but if I can figure that piece out, then I'm excited about the potential of this project.
